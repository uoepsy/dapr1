## Is lab attendance graded?

Lab attendance is not graded. In the past years, however, students who failed the assessed report tended to not attend the labs and we found a positive association between attending the labs and the grade received in the report.

## Can I change the day and/or time of my lab?

After Week 3 of semester 1 it is **not** possible to change lab day/time.

Before the end of Week 3, please submit a __Group Change Request__ form a the following link to request a change: <https://www.ed.ac.uk/timetabling-examinations/timetabling/personalised-timetables>

The university timetabling unit will process it after a few working days.

## What are formative assessments?

Formative means practice, so formative assessments do not affect your course grade. They are meant to prepare you for summative (graded) assessments that will contribute towards your final course grade. 

Formative assessments give you the opportunity to 'learn by doing'. You should not be afraid to submit what you have done, as you will receive feedback on how to improve.

## How do I apply for extensions or special circumstances?

These are handled by a separated office of the University. Please follow the steps detailed in [this website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/extensions-special-circumstances).

Note that in this course extensions are not allowed for weekly quizzes and the group reports. See the 'Assessement information' page on Learn for more information.

## Where can I get help and support?

The following is a list of sources of help and support:

-   **Labs**. Attend the labs to get help and support from tutors on the content of the lab exercises, R and RStudio, as well as lecture contents.

-   **Office Hours**. Attend office hours to receive one-to-one help on the course materials.

-   **Discussion Forum**. Search on the Piazza Discussion Forum, in case another student had the same question and it was already answered. You can also ask a new question on the Discussion Forum if no one has already asked the same question. Your student peers or instructors will be able to provide an answer to your question.

-   **Teaching organisation**. The [teaching organisation](mailto:ppls.psych@ed.ac.uk) can advise you on administrative inquiries about your course. This includes issues with submission of assessments, extensions, special circumstances, or exams.

-   **Student Adviser**. Your student adviser (you can find their name on MyEd or Euclid) is your first point of contact for generic help and support on matters that are not directly related to your course materials or organisation. They are able to also refer you to wider University services, such as the Wellbeing adviser, see below.

-   **Wellbeing adviser**. The [Wellbeing adviser](https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-wellbeing-service) can provide you with advice on wellbeing-related issues and recommend other specialist services, such as the Student Counselling Service or the Disability and Learning Support Service, who may be able to help you. You can be referred to the Wellbeing adviser by your Student adviser, or you can self-refer at the link above.
