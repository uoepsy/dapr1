# Introduction

Write here your introduction. 

Text is written outside of a code chunk, just like this. If you want to write something in italic, write it like _this_ or *this*. If you want to write something in bold, write it like __this__ or **this**.


# Analysis

Present here your analysis and results.

```{r cylBarplot, fig.cap = "Write figure caption here", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
# Example showing how to reference a previously created figure in your writeup
example_figure
```

Figure \@ref(fig:cylBarplot) displays a barplot of the number of cylinders of a sample of cars.


# Discussion

Write here the key take-home messages from the results and analyses you have presented.


# Appendix A: Additional figures and tables

Include here additional tables and figures, with captions, and properly referenced. These should be used somewhere in the text, do not include tables or figures which are not referenced anywhere in your writing.


# Appendix B: R code

Do not edit the code chunk below, but remove this paragraph of text before submitting.

```{r ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
